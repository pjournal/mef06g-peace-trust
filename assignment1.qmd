In this report, we will explore the data set of  start-ups getting investments from a variety of domestic and international investors. Data is gathered from **KPMG** and **212**’s [Turkish Startup Investments Review 2021 report](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/tr/pdf/2022/03/turkish-startup-investments-review-2021.pdf).

## KEY TAKEAWAYS OF THE REPORT 

1. In the seed stage, **Gaming** sector has the lead, in the acquistion sector, SaaS is the leader sector
2. **Gaming** is winner of number of investment category, but if we look at total deals **Ecommerce Enabler** sector is winner. This is possibly due to the **trendyol**,**hepsiburada** investments which are outliers of this category. Delivery & Logistic sector is also ahead of Gaming, this is also due to the **getir**, which is also a outlier in terms of deal amount. 
3. **Getir**  also stands out as a start-up that gets investments more than one stage (Later VC Stage, Early VC Stage) and more than once in 2021. **Servislet** is another start-up that getting investments both Seed Stage and Early VC Stage stage in 2021. These two start-ups draw attention with their rapid growth in 1 year.
3. **Gaming** sector has the highest number of investors
4. **Agritech** sector is the most multi-cultural sector in terms of different number of investor origins in one deal
5. Most of the investments made in December and August, and the most quite months are May and October, as quarters, number of total investments are **increasing** in Q3,Q4 if we compare Q1 and Q2.
6. **Fintech** startups' 73% of investments coming from Financial Investors. Interestingly, 86% of Delivery & Logistics investments and 78% of Healthtech investments coming from Financial Investors which are greater than Fintech.
7. Seed-Stage is mostly invested by Financial investors. This may be due to financial investors' willing to invest in the beginning of the start-ups to get more profit.



### DATA PREPROCESSING 
Call necessary libraries
```{r call_libraries, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Load the data

```{r load_data, message = FALSE}
data = read_excel("data//startup_deals_2021.xlsx")
```

Rename the column names
```{r preprocess_rename, message = FALSE}

data <- data %>% 
  rename(Stage = 'Investment Stage',
         Company = 'Target Company',
         DealValue = 'Deal Value (USD)',
         Financial = 'Financial Investor',
         Date = 'Announcement Date',
         Origin ="Investor's Origin",
         Stake = "Stake (%)"
  )
colnames(data)
```

* Convert "Deal Value (USD)" type to numeric data
* Convert Date column to date type, and drop year 2021, since all date values have same year, 2021
* Drop % sign for Stake, and convert to numeric data type

```{r preprocess_convert, message = FALSE}
options(scipen=999)
data$DealValue <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(data$DealValue))

data$Date <- my(data$Date)


data <- data %>% 
  mutate(Stake = str_replace_all(Stake, "%", ""))
data$Stake <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(data$Stake))
sapply(data, class)

```

Sector feature has inconsistent values like Diğital Comparison, Artificial intelligence, Cybersec urity, Telecpm, Artificial Intelligence, B lockchain.

```{r inconsistent, message = FALSE}
data_incons <- data %>%
  filter(Sector %in% c('Diğital Comparison',
'Artificial intelligence',
'Cybersec urity',
'Telecpm',
'Artificial Intelligence',
'B lockchain'
))
unique(data_incons$Sector)
```

Inconsistent Sector values are updated with the right values.
```{r}
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'Artificial intelligence'] <- 'Artificial Intelligence'
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'Telecpm'] <- 'Telecom'
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'B lockchain'] <- 'Blockchain'
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'Diğital '] <- 'Dijital'
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'Cybersec urity '] <- 'Cybersecurity'
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'Ecommerce enabler'] <- 'Ecommerce Enabler'
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'I mage process'] <- 'Image process'
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'Ecommerce enabler'] <- 'Ecommerce Enabler'
data$Sector[data$Sector == 'Data analytics'] <- 'Data Analytics'
```

Now the data is ready for the EDA,
```{r }
knitr::kable(head(data))
```

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

#### Gaming is a good start!

If we look at the number of deals **Gaming** sector is at the top in Seed stage and also in all stages!

```{r, warning = FALSE,message=FALSE}
df <- data %>% 
  group_by(Sector) %>% 
  summarise(TotalNumberofDeals=n()) %>%
  top_n(n=10) 
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Sector, y=TotalNumberofDeals)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity") + 
  ggtitle("Number of Deals vs Sectors (Top 10)")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```


```{r key_point1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sector_stage <- data %>%
  group_by(Stage,Sector) %>%
  summarise(Total = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total)) %>%
  slice_max(Total,n=3)
knitr::kable(sector_stage)

```
```{r }
ggplot(data=sector_stage, aes(x=Stage, y=Total, fill=factor(Sector))) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity") + 
  ggtitle("Investment Stage and Investment Sectors")

```






#### Deal Amounts: A General Look

Ecommerce Enabler is the winning sector if we look at the Total Deal Value(USD).
```{r, warning = FALSE}

df1 <-  data %>%
  mutate(TotalDeal = sum(DealValue,na.rm = TRUE))

 
df2 <- df1 %>%
  group_by(Sector) %>%
  summarise(RateOfDeal=(sum(DealValue,na.rm = TRUE)/TotalDeal)*100) %>%
  arrange(desc(RateOfDeal)) 
  

knitr::kable(head(unique(df2)))
```
```{r}
df3 <- df2 %>% filter(RateOfDeal>1)
df3 <- unique(df3)
ggplot(df3, aes(x="Sector", y=RateOfDeal, fill=Sector))+
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Deal(USD) Rates of Sectors (greater than 1%)")
```



#### Deal Amounts: Who makes the difference?

Gaming has the lead at number of deals, but e-commerce enablers sector is at the top of deal amounts. So, Deal Value category is investigated with a boxplot.
```{r}
df <-  data %>%
  group_by(Company,Sector) %>%
  summarise(Total=n(),TotalDealValue=sum(DealValue))  %>%
  arrange(desc(TotalDealValue))
ggplot(df) +
  aes(x = "", y = log(TotalDealValue)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#0c4c8a") +
  theme_minimal()

```
There are upper outliers and a 1 lower outlier. Let's look deeper at the upper outlier, to see which companies make the difference.

**Which companies make the difference?**

```{r}

lower_bound <- quantile(df$TotalDealValue, 0.01,na.rm = TRUE)
upper_bound <- quantile(df$TotalDealValue, 0.99,na.rm = TRUE)

upper_outlier_ind <- which(df$TotalDealValue > upper_bound)


knitr::kable(df[upper_outlier_ind, ],caption = "Companies Making Difference")

```

#### Companies which were invested in different stages
```{r}
Stage_v1 <- data %>% group_by(Company,Stage) %>%
  summarise(Investment_Count = n(),
  TotalDealValue=sum(DealValue)          
  )

Stage_v2 <- Stage_v1 %>% group_by(Company) %>%
  summarise(StageCount = n()) %>%
  filter(StageCount>1)

Morethanonestage <-data %>%
                    select(Company,Sector,DealValue,Date,Stage) %>%
                    filter(Company %in% Stage_v2$Company) 

knitr::kable(Morethanonestage,caption = "Companies which invested in different stages")
```

#### Investors 

If we look at the number of investors, Gaming is also winner for this category.
**Investor Numbers by Sectors**

```{r}
data_investor <- mutate(data,
       investor_number = sapply(strsplit(as.character(data$Investor), ","), length))

investor_gg <- data_investor %>%
  group_by(Sector) %>%
  summarise(TotalNumberInvestor=sum(investor_number))  %>%
  arrange(desc(TotalNumberInvestor)) %>%
  slice_max(TotalNumberInvestor,n=10)

ggplot(data=investor_gg, aes(x=Sector, y=TotalNumberInvestor)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity") + 
  ggtitle("Number of Investors by Sectors") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

**Investor Numbers by Origins : Most Multi-cultural Sector : Agritech **

**Agritech** sector is the most multi-cultural sector in terms of different number of investor origins in one deal

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

data_inv_origin <- mutate(data,
       origin_number = sapply(strsplit(as.character(data$Origin), ","), length)) 

inv_or_sec <- data_inv_origin %>%
  group_by(Sector) %>%
  summarise(MaxOriginNumber = max(origin_number),MeanOriginNumber = mean(origin_number)) %>%
  filter(MaxOriginNumber>1) %>%
  arrange(desc(MaxOriginNumber)) %>%
  top_n(5)

 
knitr::kable(inv_or_sec)
```

**Investors: Financial or Non-Financial?**

**Fintech** startups' 73% of investments coming from Financial Investors. Interestingly, 86% of Delivery & Logistics investments and 78% of Healthtech investments coming from Financial Investors which are greater than Fintech.

```{r}

df1 <- data %>%
  group_by(Sector) %>%
  summarise(
    Total = n(),
    Financial = sum(Financial == "Yes")
  ) %>%
  mutate(FinancialInvestorPercentage =(Financial/Total)*100 ) %>%
  filter(Total>1) %>%
  arrange(desc(Financial),desc(FinancialInvestorPercentage))

knitr::kable(head(df1,10))
```


#### When the investments take place most? 

Total number of deals are **increasing** in Q3,Q4 if we compare Q1 and Q2.

```{r warning=FALSE}
df <-  data %>%
  mutate(Month = month(data$Date, label=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(Quarter = paste("2021 Q", quarter(data$Date)))  %>%
  group_by(Quarter) %>%
  summarise(Total=n())%>%
  arrange(Quarter) 

ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Quarter, y=Total, group=1)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point() +
  ylim(0,100) +
  ggtitle("Number of Investments Quarters - 2021")


```
Most of the investments made in December and August, and the most quite months are May and October.

```{r warning=FALSE}
df1 <-  data %>%
  mutate(Month = month(data$Date, label=TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(Total=n())%>%
  arrange(Month) 

ggplot(data=df1, aes(x=Month, y=Total, group=1)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point() +
  ylim(0,100) +
  ggtitle("Number of Investments Monthly - 2021")
```

#### Which state to invest? Non-financial and financial investors

We can say that Seed Stage has been mostly invested by Financial investors and Acquisition stage mostly invested by Non-Financial investors.

```{r warning=FALSE}
  ggplot(data,aes(x = Stage, y=Sector, fill = Financial)) +
    geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",
                 dotsize=1,binwidth = 1)
```
#### Which investor making the highest number of investment according to sector in every investment stage 
```{r}
data_investor %>% separate_rows(Investor,sep = ",") %>%  head()
```
```{r}
df_investor<-data_investor %>% separate_rows(Investor,sep = ",")
df_investor <- df_investor %>% select(Investor,Stage,Sector)
df_investor %>% group_by(Stage,Sector,Investor) %>% summarise(Number_of_invesmment=n()) %>% arrange(desc(Number_of_invesmment))
```
** So if we have a company in the seed stage and in the gaming sector, it is very meaningfull to aim ınvestors like "Games United" and "WePlay Ventures" in order to get investment **
