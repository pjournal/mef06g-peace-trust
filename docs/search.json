    "text": "KEY TAKEAWAYS OF THE REPORT\n\nIn the seed stage, Gaming sector has the lead, in the acquistion sector, SaaS is the leader sector\nGaming is winner of number of investment category, but if we look at total deals Ecommerce Enabler sector is winner. This is possibly due to the trendyol,hepsiburada investments which are outliers of this category. Delivery & Logistic sector is also ahead of Gaming, this is also due to the getir, which is also a outlier in terms of deal amount.\nGetir also stands out as a start-up that gets investments more than one stage (Later VC Stage, Early VC Stage) and more than once in 2021. Servislet is another start-up that getting investments both Seed Stage and Early VC Stage stage in 2021. These two start-ups draw attention with their rapid growth in 1 year.\nGaming sector has the highest number of investors\nAgritech sector is the most multi-cultural sector in terms of different number of investor origins in one deal\nMost of the investments made in December and August, and the most quite months are May and October, as quarters, number of total investments are increasing in Q3,Q4 if we compare Q1 and Q2.\nFintech startups’ 73% of investments coming from Financial Investors. Interestingly, 86% of Delivery & Logistics investments and 78% of Healthtech investments coming from Financial Investors which are greater than Fintech.\nSeed-Stage is mostly invested by Financial investors. This may be due to financial investors’ willing to invest in the beginning of the start-ups to get more profit.\n\n\nDATA PREPROCESSING\nCall necessary libraries\n\n\nShow the
